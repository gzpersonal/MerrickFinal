  <body>Gaming computers are designed to be significantly more powerful than regular desktops or laptops. They are designed to be able to play high intensity graphically demanding games.

   <p1> Personally i have the HP Omen gaming laptop with an RX graphics card and i7 cpu. It costs roughly 1.2k and can run all triple A titles at 60+ FPS.

    <p2>When i was choosing a laptop to buy i watched many different reviews and I found a great youtuber who made excellent points on the Omen that ultimatly made my decision clear.
